My name's David Eyers (or Dave, I don't mind which) and I'm an academic in the Department of Computer Science at the University of Otago. I have perilously broad research interests covering engineering and applications within cloud computing, distributed systems, green computing, network and computer security, and the support of eResearch tools and technologies. I am keen to help others acquire efficient and reproducible scientific workflows through the recent surge in excellent "devops" tools. I also really enjoy teaching: Software Carpentry will hopefully allow me both to teach, and also to study the effectiveness of this teaching.
