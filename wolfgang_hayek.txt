My name is Wolfgang Hayek, I am based in Wellington, and I work as a HPC scientific programmer for NIWA and for NeSI (New Zealand eScience Infrastructure). My responsibilities include supporting science users who want to run their projects on HPC hardware, teaching scientific computing skills, looking after a range of scientific production codes at NIWA, as well as working on code development projects with scientists from different fields.
