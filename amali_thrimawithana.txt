My name is Amali Thrimawithana and I am bioinformatician at the New Zealand Institute for Plant and Food Research Limited (based in Auckland). At Plant and Food, I have been involved in several research projects, including projects focusing on fungal pathogens, insect and plant, where I have undertaken bioinformatics analysis including de novo assembly and annotation of genomes and transcriptomes, differential expression as well as comparative genomics.
